THIS IS SOME MATH:
$$
   \\int_0^1 x^n dx = \\frac{1}{n+1}
$$

This is some code:

```
   a[1] = 1
   .
   b[i] = 2

This is a quote:

\\begin{quotation}
   Regular languages are rather inexpressive,
   but they work great for lexers. On the opposite
   side of expressivity spectrum are Turing machines.
   For them, we also have a number of meta-languages
   (like Rust), which work great for humans.
   Itâ€™s interesting that a Turing machine is
   equivalent to a finite state machine with
   a pair of stacks: to get two stacks from a tape,
   cut the tape in half where the head is. Moving
   the head then corresponds to popping from one
   stack and pushing to another.
